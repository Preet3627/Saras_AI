# Saras AI Robot: The Ultimate RASPBOT V2 Upgrade

This repository contains the source code for a web-based, step-by-step guide to transform the [Yahboom RASPBOT V2](https://www.yahboom.net/study/RASPBOT-V2) into an intelligent, interactive AI assistant named "Saras". This project integrates the power of Google's Gemini API to give the robot advanced capabilities, from understanding its surroundings to responding in multiple languages.

This project was developed for **PM SHRI PRATHMIK VIDHYAMANDIR PONSRI**.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to provide a clear, comprehensive guide for students and hobbyists to upgrade their RASPBOT V2. The final robot, Saras, will be able to perform a wide range of tasks from a single, unified command structure, activated by a custom wake word.

## Features of the Upgraded "Saras" Robot

The guide walks you through implementing the following features:

-   🤖 **Unified Command Center**: All features are designed to be operable through a single, natural language command interface.
-   🗣️ **Custom Wake Word**: Activates listening mode upon hearing **"Hey Saras"**.
-   🧠 **Google Gemini API Integration**: Connects the robot to real-world data and provides powerful language and vision understanding.
-   👁️ **AI Vision**: Saras can capture images, analyze them using Gemini, and describe what it sees out loud.
-   📚 **Object Detection & Interaction**: Can perform tasks like identifying and finding a book.
-   🚗 **Autonomous Behavior**: Capable of advanced actions like following a specific object (e.g., a car) and avoiding obstacles.
-   💬 **Custom Personality & Multilingual Responses**:
    -   Delivers a pre-defined introduction in **Gujarati**.
    -   Greets new faces (humans or dogs) with a polite **"Namaste"** in Gujarati on the first encounter.
-   💡 **Visual Feedback**: Utilizes RGB LEDs to display a Google-themed animation when the wake word is detected, providing clear visual cues.

## About This Web Application

The code in this repository is for the **instructional web guide itself**, not the Python code that runs on the robot. This application is built with React and Tailwind CSS to present the upgrade steps in an easy-to-follow, interactive format. Each step includes explanations and ready-to-use Python code snippets.

## How to Use This Guide

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the step-by-step guide. No complex build setup is required as the application uses modern web standards and a CDN for dependencies.

## Technology Stack (for the Guide)

-   **React**: For building the user interface.
-   **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
